# PROBLEM #2
# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#  1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#  (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
# Hence, the difference between the sum of the squares of the
# first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
# 
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
# one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
